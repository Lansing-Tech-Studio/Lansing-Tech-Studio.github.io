  <h2>About the Camp</h2>
  <p>Our interactive <b>PyBricks Summer Coding Camp</b> is designed for young builders and programmers. PyBricks is a modern, easy-to-use Python coding environment for LEGO® hubs. Kids will learn to bring their LEGO creations to life by writing code and experimenting with sensors and motors.</p>

  <h3>☀️ Camp Structure & Schedule</h3>
  <p>Join us for a fun and focused coding experience at the end of June or early July.</p>
