We're thrilled to officially launch the new Lansing Tech Studio website! This has been a labor of love created by our student developers and mentors, and we couldn't be more excited to share it with our community.

## What Makes Us Different

At Lansing Tech Studio, we believe that technology education should be:

- **Hands-on**: Students learn by building, coding, and creating real projects
- **Collaborative**: Teamwork and peer learning are at the heart of everything we do  
- **Community-focused**: We use our skills to make a positive impact in our local community
- **Inclusive**: Everyone is welcome, regardless of experience level or background

## Current Season Update

Our FIRST LEGO League teams are deep into preparation for the upcoming regional tournament on January 25th. This year's challenge, "SUBMERGEDâ„ ," has pushed our students to think creatively about ocean exploration and conservation.

### Team Highlights:
- **Robo Sharks**: Working on an innovative coral reef restoration project
- **Deep Sea Coders**: Developing underwater cleanup solutions
- **Ocean Explorers**: Focusing on marine life protection initiatives

Each team has been meeting every Saturday since September, and their dedication and creativity continue to amaze us.

## Looking Ahead

We have several exciting initiatives planned for 2025:

### Spring Programs
- **Coding Bootcamp**: 8-week intensive Python programming course (March-April)
- **Web Development Workshop**: Build your first website (May)
- **Arduino Adventures**: Hardware programming for beginners (June)

### Summer Opportunities
- **STEM Summer Camp**: Week-long day camps for different age groups
- **Maker Projects**: Advanced building and programming challenges
- **Community Service Intensive**: Major community impact projects

### New Partnerships
