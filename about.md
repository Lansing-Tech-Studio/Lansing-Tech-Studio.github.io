## What is FIRST?

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international youth organization that operates robotics competitions to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology.

### FIRST LEGO League (FLL)
FIRST LEGO League Challenge is a robotics program for students ages 9-16 that combines the excitement of sport with the rigor of science and technology. Teams research a real-world problem, develop a solution, and compete with LEGO-based robots.

**Key Components:**
- **Robot Game**: Design and program a LEGO robot to complete missions
- **Innovation Project**: Identify and solve a real-world problem
- **Core Values**: Teamwork, discovery, inclusion, innovation, impact, and fun

As the Director of Operations at Lansing Tech Studio, I am at the forefront of bringing our core mission to life: cultivating the next generation of local tech leadership through dynamic, hands-on, project-based learning. My daily focus is centered on translating our business plan into an effective reality, overseeing our operational strategy, creating community partners, and ensuring our innovative programs are accessible, impactful, and deeply connected to the needs of the Lansing community.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
My academic foundation is built upon dual Master of Science degrees, providing the strategic expertise necessary to develop and scale our educational offerings with rigor. This academic background is enhanced by the values and practical experience I've gained as a hybrid homeschool mom. My personal experience in curriculum development and fostering engaged learning environments directly informs my work. I have a profound appreciation for personalized learning paths and the critical role a supportive community plays in a student's success.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
These insights are essential as I oversee our programs, which range from the FLL Robotics Competition and the Youth Leadership Track to our extensive service-learning initiatives. I am passionate about creating opportunities where technology is a catalyst for positive change, which is clearly demonstrated through our annual student Tech Demo Day, projects like HackerFest, and our community service work. Building and mentoring our dedicated leadership team is a significant joy in my role. I am dedicated to building a welcoming and empowering space for everyone at Lansing Tech Studio.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Beyond the Studio:</strong> I cherish time spent with my husband and three children—my boys and my stepdaughter. I recharge through running, creative crafts, and, of course, seeking out good food!

<p class="bio-description">
As the Director of Technology at Lansing Tech Studio, I focus on turning curiosity into capability. I started writing software over 30 years ago, trying to get more out of my TI-85 calculator than the built-in functions allowed. Today, I lead the design and delivery of our hands-on, project-based technology programs, making sure students don’t just use tools, but truly understand how they work and how to build their own.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Over the years, I’ve worked as a software engineer, architect, and Site Reliability Engineer across logistics, insurance, legal, healthcare, and government. No matter the role, I’ve always gravitated toward mentoring junior developers, simplifying complex systems, and creating pathways for others to grow. I’ve also been active in our regional tech community, serving on the steering committee for the Mid-Michigan Agile Group and leading the Lansing DevOps Meetup to help connect and equip local technology professionals.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
My journey into technology wasn’t straightforward. I didn’t have access to computers as a kid—just that one TI-85 in high school—so it took me years (and a few misfit careers) to realize that I kept using computers to improve every job I had. I wasn’t diagnosed as autistic until I was 40 and didn’t understand that I was dyslexic until 30. Those experiences deeply shape my commitment at Lansing Tech Studio: I want today’s youth to discover their strengths earlier, have access to the tools I didn’t, and learn in environments that embrace neurodiversity, different learning styles, and the power of personalized, project-based education.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Beyond the Studio:</strong> I love spending time with my wife and our kids, playing board games, putting together puzzles, doing homework, or just hanging out. When I'm alone I enjoy running, listening to podcasts, and exploring new programming languages and technologies.

## Our Story

Founded in 2020, Lansing Tech Studio began as a small group of passionate educators and technologists who saw the need for more hands-on STEM education in our community. What started as a single FIRST LEGO League team has grown into a comprehensive youth development program serving dozens of students across multiple programs.

We believe that every young person deserves the opportunity to explore technology, develop problem-solving skills, and discover their potential. Through our programs, students don't just learn to code or build robots – they learn to think critically, work collaboratively, and approach challenges with confidence and creativity.

## Community Impact

Since our founding, we've:
- Supported over 50 students in competitive robotics
- Conducted 100+ hours of workshops and training
- Participated in 25+ community service projects
- Mentored students who have gone on to pursue STEM careers
- Built partnerships with local schools and community organizations
