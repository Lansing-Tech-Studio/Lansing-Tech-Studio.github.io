## What is FIRST?

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international youth organization that operates robotics competitions to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology.

### FIRST LEGO League (FLL)
FIRST LEGO League Challenge is a robotics program for students ages 9-16 that combines the excitement of sport with the rigor of science and technology. Teams research a real-world problem, develop a solution, and compete with LEGO-based robots.

**Key Components:**
- **Robot Game**: Design and program a LEGO robot to complete missions
- **Innovation Project**: Identify and solve a real-world problem
- **Core Values**: Teamwork, discovery, inclusion, innovation, impact, and fun

## Our Story

Founded in 2020, Lansing Tech Studio began as a small group of passionate educators and technologists who saw the need for more hands-on STEM education in our community. What started as a single FIRST LEGO League team has grown into a comprehensive youth development program serving dozens of students across multiple programs.

We believe that every young person deserves the opportunity to explore technology, develop problem-solving skills, and discover their potential. Through our programs, students don't just learn to code or build robots ‚Äì they learn to think critically, work collaboratively, and approach challenges with confidence and creativity.

## Community Impact

Since our founding, we've:
- Supported over 50 students in competitive robotics
- Conducted 100+ hours of workshops and training
- Participated in 25+ community service projects
- Mentored students who have gone on to pursue STEM careers
- Built partnerships with local schools and community organizations
